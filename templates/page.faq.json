Swimming pools are usually treated with chlorine, and chlorine reacts with sterling silver.  So depending on how much chlorine is in the pool, you’ll probably have to clean your silver with a silver polishing cloth if you’re swimming frequently.<br\/><br\/>Hot Tubs are not recommended. There’s even more chlorine in hot tubs, and it’s hot. Chemical reactions generally speed up at higher temperatures, so I’d definitely try to take off your silver before getting in the pool. You might notice a definite color change afterwards that could take a lot of cleaning.<br\/><br\/>Salt Water is not the end of the world. Salt can be corrosive and can also leave residue on your jewelry which should be cleaned off.  If you can, take it off before going in the water. If you forget, try to rinse it and dry it off with some clean water afterwards.<br\/><br\/>Hot Springs are not recommended. Hot springs often contain a lot of different minerals, specifically Sulfur.  Jewelers use Sulfuric acid to intentionally oxidize silver jewelry so you could be in for a big color change here. We advise against wearing your silver jewelry in any kind of hot spring.<br\/><\/p>"
